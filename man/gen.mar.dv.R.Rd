\usage{
gen.mar.dv.R(data, R, miss_prob, var, varlist, dv_miss_prob, miss.bound.on,
  miss.bound.val, max_miss, directory, seed)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataset you want to inflict the missingness on}

\item{R}{Number of datasets you want.}

\item{var}{which variable will cause the missingness?}

\item{varlist}{which variables will be used in the dataset?}

\item{dv_miss_prob}{set the probability that the dv will go missing}

\item{miss.bound.on}{set the missing boundary on, creating a MNAR/MAR
scenario.
= 1 when you want the missingness to only occur when
miss.bound.valary is a certain value
= 0 when you don't want the missingness to occur
according to a miss.bound.value}

\item{miss.bound.val}{at what value do you want things to go missing?
e.g., from value 60 - make the missingness occur}

\item{max_miss}{what is the probability that things will go missing
if miss.bound is on?}

\item{directory}{where you want the file to be saved, e.g.,
                "~/Dropbox/ALL THE THINGS/PhD/MD_Paper_Prep/knitr/
2014_28_04_miss_data_sim/simulated_data/mcar"}

\item{seed}{set the random seed so that the results can be replicated.
#examples}

\item{miss.perc}{percent of missing data you want (approximately)}
}
\value{
this function currently saves as an Rdataset.
}
\description{
\code{sim_miss_data} generates a dataframe with a specified missingness
pattern.
}
\details{
This function gives the user a great deal of control over creating different
patterns of missingness, however it was created with a specific purpose in
mind, and so it might actually need to be broken up into a couple of
different functions, as it is quite a large function.
