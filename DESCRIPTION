Description: mex provides a small toolbox for the researcher to explore their
    missing data. These tools consist of: t-tests and chi2, CART, BRT,
    clustering, and a missing data simulator.  The t-test / chi2 tests compare
    whether the missingness is affecting the expected count or mean value.  The
    CART (rpart) and BRT (gbm and gbm.step) functions explore the proportion
    of missing data in a row, and also interact with clustering (undecided
    method) of missingness.  The data simulation function also makes it
    easy to create specific missingness patterns, as well as compare theorized
    missingness patterns found in your research.
